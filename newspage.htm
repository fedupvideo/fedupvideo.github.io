		<p><font face="Arial" size="4" color="#FFFFFF">- Also after watching the 
		video, I felt like the music section is a bit too empty so I also 
		decided to add a description section into it, have fun reading a thing 
		or two about the songs I uploaded :)</font></p>
		<p><font face="Arial" size="4" color="#FFFFFF">- And talking about 
		songs, I also uploaded more new songs on here which includes the new two 
		remixes and the short song Tarleaf used in the video :)</font></p>

		that my website host has a file size limit so I couldn't upload the 
		direct archive here so both archives will remain untouched for now which 
		is a bummer :p</font></p>
		<p><font face="Arial" size="4" color="#FFFFFF">- Also, there are two

		introduction voice but it might take long since I know people are busy 
		and all and this is more like a fun side-project.</font></p>
		<p><font face="Arial" size="4" color="#FFFFFF">- So the channel might

		it's not like I have a deadline or anything which of course wouldn't 
		work well for a passion project like this</font></p>
		<p><font face="Arial" size="4" color="#FFFFFF">- And have a good day for
